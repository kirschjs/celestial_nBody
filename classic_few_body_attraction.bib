abstract="The flight of a space craft to the moon, such as we have dealt with in
Chap. 7, is a special case of the three-body problem of celestial mechanics. The
latter is understood to be the problem of calculating the motion of three point-like
masses which move under the sole influence of the mutual gravitational forces.",

  \item [{$\tilde {\vb {r}}$}]\begingroup Bold symbols denote, if not stated otherwise, three-dimensional vectors, e.g., $\vb {r}=\qty (x,y,z)$, the length/magnitude of a vector $r:=\vqty {\vb {r}}$, and the tilde refers to vectors in the centre-of-mass frame.\nomeqref {0}\nompageref{1}
  \item [{$N,M,A$}]\begingroup Of $N$ objects, the orbits of $M$ are fixed which leaves $N-M:=A$ trajectories for which we seek a solution.\nomeqref {0}\nompageref{2}
  \item [{dimer}]\begingroup \hypertarget {nom.dimer}{With \emph {dimer}, we refer to a pair of particles which are \emph {loosely} bound, i.e., a small disturbance suffices to induce a transition from a trajectory on which the relative distance between them does not diverge when $t\to \infty $ to one on which it does.}\nomeqref {0}\nompageref{1}
  \item [{M}]\begingroup total mass of the system, $M=\sum _{i=1}^N m_i$\nomeqref {0}\nompageref{1}

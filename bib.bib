abstract = {Developments in the application of hyperspherical coordinates in a unified treatment of bound states and resonances of two-electron atomic systems and other general Coulomb three-body systems are reviewed. It is shown that the nature of the internal normal modes of such three-body systems can be examined within the adiabatic approximation where the hyperradius is treated as an adiabatic parameter. From the nodal lines in the internal coordinates, it is shown how a set of new quantum numbers can be assigned. The most recent progress in the application of hyperspherical close coupling method to the photoabsorption of two-electron atoms and to rearrangement collisions is also addressed.}
